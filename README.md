# Numerical Analysis Learning App
A web-based learning application designed to help students understand **Numerical Analysis** concepts through **step-by-step computation, error analysis, and visualization**.

This application focuses on *learning and understanding*, not just producing final answers.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This app is built to:
- Visualize numerical methods step-by-step
- Show iteration processes and convergence behavior
- Help beginners understand **why** a method works or fails
- Serve as a learning aid for Numerical Analysis courses

---

## 📚 Covered Topics (Planned)

Based on a standard Numerical Analysis syllabus:

### ✅ Root Finding (Priority)
- Bisection Method  
- Regula Falsi  
- Newton–Raphson  
- Secant Method  

### 🔄 Error & Convergence Analysis
- Absolute error
- Relative error
- Iterative error
- Tolerance-based stopping criteria

### 📈 Interpolation (Planned)
- Lagrange Polynomial
- Newton Polynomial
- Interpolation error

### ➕ Future Extensions
- Numerical Integration (Trapezoidal, Simpson)
- Numerical Differentiation
- Ordinary Differential Equations (Euler, Runge–Kutta)

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Step-by-step iteration tables
- Error calculation at each iteration
- Automatic convergence detection
- Graph visualization:
  - Function plots
  - Error vs iteration
- Beginner-friendly explanations in simple language
